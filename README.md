Code examples from Python Machine Learning Second Edition

The best way to learn is by doing! This repository offers a selection of notebooks replicating (and often slightly modifying) code examples from [Python Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka-ebook/dp/B00YSILNL0).

I would highly recommend this book to others as a reference to many fundamental machine learning concepts. The original, and complete, code examples can be found [here](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition#whats-new-in-the-second-edition-from-the-first-edition).
